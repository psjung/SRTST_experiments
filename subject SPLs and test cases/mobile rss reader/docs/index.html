The free RSS feed reader is an J2ME MIDP mobile (cell phone) application that
is able to read most RSS servers/feed versions. RSS is a lightweight XML format
designed for sharing headlines and other content like blogs and news.   Date
is stored on the device and updated on request.  This uses the internet which
service providers charge extra for, so you would best get an unlimited data
from your service provider.  This should work with most recent devices as
they have MIDP 2.0.  If it does not work, use the midp10_... version which is
for older versions.  This is licensed under GPL.

<p>
The import feature has filters.  This is because there are some OPML files
that have 1,500 (SIC) links.  This would cause the program to
run out of memory not to memtion be
unmanagable.  Say you only want the ones that are about Tech.
Use the name filter with 'Tech' in it to get just the ones with Tech.
Some sites have an HTML file (URL) with links to RSS.  This file will
likely have both links for RSS and other links.  Usually, the RSS
links have a pattern in them like rss or xml.  Put rss or xml in the
link filter to just import these.  Usually to use the HTML link feature,
you will need to open the page with view source and see what
to use as the filter.
