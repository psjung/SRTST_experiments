And the Puppets</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070906_002891.html"&gt;I, Cringely&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple announced a variety of new and kinda-new iPods dominated by the iPod Touch (iPhone minus the phone) and an iPod Nano with video (great for watching miniseries). At the very end of the presentation, Jobs announced the iPhone price cut. Why did he wait until the very end? Because he knew the news would be disruptive and might have obscured his presentation of the new products. He KNEW there was going to be controversy. So much for the “Steve is simply out of touch with the world” theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did he do it? Why did he cut the price? I have no inside information here, but it seems pretty obvious to me: Apple introduced the iPhone at $599 to milk the early adopters and somewhat limit demand then dropped the price to $399 (the REAL price) to stimulate demand now that the product is a critical success and relatively bug-free. At least 500,000 iPhones went out at the old price, which means Apple made $100 million in extra profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had nobody complained, Apple would have left it at that. But Jobs expected complaints and had an answer waiting — the $100 Apple store credit. This was no knee-jerk reaction, either. It was already there just waiting if needed. Apple keeps an undeserved $50 million and customers get $50 million back. Or do they? Some customers will never use their store credit. Those who do use it will nearly all buy something that costs more than $100. And, most importantly, those who bought their iPhones at an AT&amp;T store will have to make what might be their first of many visits to an Apple Store. That is alone worth the $50 per customer this escapade will eventually cost Apple, taking into account unused credits and Apple Store wholesale costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Apple still comes out $75 million ahead, which is important to Steve Jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve has a love-hate relationship with, well, everyone. Customers buy Apple products and they appreciate Steve’s design and market sense, but they also have opinions and NEEDS — two characteristics Jobs (and for that matter almost any CEO) would like to do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Steve slapped his customers around a bit and what happened? Apple got free publicity worth tens of millions and the iPhone, which was already the top-selling smartphone in the world, will now sell two million units by the end of the year, up from an estimated one million. And Steve, having deliberately alienated his best customers, now gets a chance to woo them back. He has finally placed millions of people in the role of every key Apple employee — being alternately seduced and tormented. In this case the torment is over and the seduction will come next month when Apple ships OS X 10.5 (Leopard) — the company’s last chance to position its products for Christmas. Look for 1-2 very un-Leopard surprises at that event — surprises intended to get us all dreamy-eyed over Steve Jobs again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is, perhaps, the most intelligent thing I've ever read about Steve Jobs. And he's dead-on about the connection between Apple fans and Apple employees: Jobs treats them both like utter crap--his trademark--and they just love him more for it. That he has been able to extend this relationship, remotely, to customers is astonishing. Steve Jobs is a god. An angry, spiteful god, but a god nonetheless. I know why you worship him. But I fear for you all the same.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/puppet-master-and-puppets.htm' title='The Puppet Master ...

Check out this &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; from Steve Jobs:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have received hundreds of emails from iPhone customers who are upset about Apple dropping the price of iPhone by $200 two months after it went on sale. After reading every one of these emails, I have some observations and conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I am sure that we are making the correct decision to lower the price of the 8GB iPhone from $599 to $399, and that now is the right time to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, being in technology for 30+ years I can attest to the fact that the technology road is bumpy. There is always change and improvement, and there is always someone who bought a product before a particular cutoff date and misses the new price or the new operating system or the new whatever. This is life in the technology lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, even though we are making the right decision to lower the price of iPhone, and even though the technology road is bumpy, we need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price. Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, we have decided to offer every iPhone customer who purchased an iPhone from either Apple or AT&amp;T, and who is not receiving a rebate or any other consideration, a $100 store credit towards the purchase of any product at an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Online Store. Details are still being worked out and will be posted on Apple's website next week. Stay tuned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hmm. Given that virtually everyone who bought an iPhone in the first two months was a huge Apple fan, this will probably satisfy most people. But this isn't a rebate at all, and I think that would have been a nicer gesture. Still, this is better than nothing, obviously.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/open-letter-to-all-iphone-customers.htm' title='An open letter to all iPhone customers'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/380725287399794431'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/380725287399794431'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-5881786944218964117</id><published>2007-09-06T10:44:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-06T10:53:32.459-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Linux'/><title type='text'>KDE 4.0 Beta 2 Release Announcement</title><content type='html'>Yikes.

This release marks the beginning of the feature freeze and the stabilization of the current codebase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the libraries were frozen with the first Beta, KDE developers have been adding features and functionality to their applications. Now it is time to start polishing these features; writing and translating documentation, improving the usability, and completing the artwork. As KDE 4.0 is feature-frozen now, going into bugfixing mode, major ideas and changes will be held off until 4.1. However, some KDE components, such as Plasma, are exempt from this freeze and will still see significant improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following months will see fanatical work to stabilize the KDE applications and libraries, and the finishing touch on the components not yet frozen. Two further beta's are planned, after which KDE will be frozen for a release candidate cycle ending in a release planned around Christmas at the end of the year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Related, if not nearly as interesting: &lt;a href="http://www.koffice.org/announcements/announce-2.0alpha3.php"&gt;KOffice 2.0 Alpha 3 Release Announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tero.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/kde-40-beta-2-release-announcement.htm' title='KDE 4.0 Beta 2 Release Announcement'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/5881786944218964117'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/5881786944218964117'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-9114246929322611752</id><published>2007-09-06T09:47:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-06T09:48:55.019-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Internet'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Microsoft'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Humor'/><title type='text'>The internet on a disc</title><content type='html'>Tell me &lt;a href="http://bestpicever.com/pic-905-The-internet-on-a-disc"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; isn't beautiful. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://bestpicever.com/pic-905-The-internet-on-a-disc"&gt;&lt;img src="http://pics.bestpicever.com/pics/pic_112295001188948907.jpg" width="400" height="420" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/internet-on-disc.htm' title='The internet on a disc'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/9114246929322611752'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/9114246929322611752'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-6737190388085412392</id><published>2007-09-05T19:34:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-05T23:12:25.681-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iPhone'/><title type='text'>The $200 Question</title><content type='html'>So Apple took the unprecedented step of lowering the price of the iPhone by $200 to $400. Folks, that's a 33 percent price drop, and when you combine that with the fact that the iPhone has only been out for two months, I mean... My God. It's kind of insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion on this is that the iPhone isn't selling as well as Apple would like. You just don't drop prices that aggressively so quickly. Ever. Especially when you own mindshare like white owns rice. Especially when you're the company that can do no wrong. Today's iPod announcements would have been incredible without the iPhone price drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's just an opinion. The question, of course, is this: Does this price cut screw the early adopters? You know, the people who actually waited in line, like lemmings, to get an overpriced gadget that will eventually sell millions of copies. The people who would pay anything for any product Apple cares to sell. The fanatics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, is Apple just doing The Right Thing (tm) and moving quickly to overcome what has clearly been the iPhone's biggest complaint? (Well, after EDGE. And that virtual keyboard. And the weird recessed headphone jack. And the insane international roaming bills. And... well, you get the idea.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the iPhone a 3/5 rating in my recent review, and while I stand by that, I know that a lot of the Apple fans feel differently about this trendsetting product. Does this price cut change anything?

But as anyone who waited for an iPod mini back in early 2004 will tell you, an Apple announcement does not a product availability make. (Or, ahem, whatever.) So when can we actually expect to see these new products (in the US)? Here's a timeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod shuffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status: A hold-over from last year, but with new colors&lt;br /&gt;Pricing: $79 ($1 GB)&lt;br /&gt;Availability: Immediate&lt;br /&gt;Apple Store delivery estimate: Within 24 hours, but green version is "not available"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod nano&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status: Completely redesigned hardware and software&lt;br /&gt;Pricing: $149 (4 GB), $199 (8 GB)&lt;br /&gt;Availability: This weekend&lt;br /&gt;Apple Store shipping estimate: 1-3 business days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod classic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status: Hardware is held-over from 2005, but with new software UI&lt;br /&gt;Pricing: $249 (80 GB), $349 (160 GB)&lt;br /&gt;Availability: This weekend&lt;br /&gt;Apple Store shipping estimate: 1-3 business days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod touch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status: Completely new model, based on iPhone&lt;br /&gt;Pricing: $299 (8 GB), $399 (16 GB)&lt;br /&gt;Availability: Late this month&lt;br /&gt;Apple Store shipping estimate: By September 28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPhone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Status: 4 GB model dropped, now just a single model, otherwise unchanged &lt;br /&gt;Pricing: $399 (8 GB)&lt;br /&gt;Availability: Immediate&lt;br /&gt;Apple Store shipping estimate: Within 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be interesting to see how the iPod touch availability, especially, matches Apple's promise. And let's not forget the weird new Starbucks service for the iPod touch and iPhone: According to Apple, that service will debut in New York and Seattle on October 2, 2007, and then be added to 350 Starbucks stores in the San Francisco Bay area on November 7, 2007, then 500 stores in Los Angeles in early February 2008, 300 stores in Chicago in March 2008, and additional markets throughout the US later in 2008. The service will be available throughout the US sometime in 2009.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/apple-fall-2007-products-timeline.htm' title='Apple Fall 2007 Products: A Timeline'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/8584222061941074031'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/8584222061941074031'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-2007223481587589977</id><published>2007-09-05T14:56:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-05T20:19:40.559-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Zune'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iPhone'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iPod'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Apple'/><title type='text'>First impressions: 'The Beat Goes On' Announcements</title><content type='html'>While I'll be reviewing Apple's new lineup of iPods on the SuperSite for Windows, I thought it would be interesting to toss out some thoughts about the devices based on the recently completed special event at which they were introduced. As always, the iPod line remains the standard by which all other portable media players are judged, and the Fall 2007 lineup is the strongest yet. Here's what it looks like, along with other revelations from "The Beat Goes On":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;No Beatles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite persistent rumors and constant Beatles references during the Jobs keynote, "The Beatles" catalog was not made available on iTunes. (Yet.) Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod facts and figures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The domination of iTunes and the iPod is astonishing. According to Apple, the company has distributed over 600 million copies of iTunes and has sold over 3 billion songs, 95 million TV shows, and has provided over 125,000 podcasts to listeners. Astonishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple has sold over 110 million iPods to date, also astonishing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod shuffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple added new colors and not much else to the $79 iPod shuffle, which was thoroughly revamped for last year. New colors include red (as in Product[RED]), purple, light blue, and light green, in addition to last year's silver color. Otherwise, the shuffle hasn't changed, up to and including the same 1 GB of storage space. This is mostly OK: The shuffle was fine as-is, but you'd think Apple might have bumped the storage to at least 2 GB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod nano&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best-selling nano is getting quite a bit fatter/wider thanks to a new QVGA 320 x 240 screen (equal to that of last year's iPod with video) that supports video as well as Cover Flow; it also comes with 3 iPod games. While I question the width increase of the new device (coming as it does with a non-updated music-only iPod shuffle), the new nano looks neat. It is all metal (though I doubt anyone was actually asking for that), thinner than before, and appears more rounded on the edges than the too-sharp-edged iPod with video from last year. It sports 24 hours of battery life for audio and 5 hours for video, both excellent. Pricing is reasonable at $149 for a 4 GB version and $199 for 8 GB. The new nano is available in five colors: black, red, gray, blue, and green. They look great overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod classic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the old iPod with video (which some people think of simply as "iPod") is the new iPod classic. This player doesn't appear to be particularly exceptional other than the new storage options: It's the same basic size and shape as the previous iPod, but appears to have rounded edges, like the nano. (Assuming that's the case. It may be a photographic trick.) Anyway, the iPod classic is now all-metal (whatever), thinner than before, and comes in 80 GB and 160 GB variants. The 80 GB version gets 30 hours of battery life for audio and 6 hours for video; it costs $250. The 160 GB version gets 40 hours of battery life for audio and 7 hours for video; it costs $350. Both are reasonably priced, though the tiny screen is increasingly uninteresting in the wake of the Zune, iPod touch (see below), and iPhone. As before, the iPod classic comes only in black and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPod touch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably the most impressive introduction of the event and the one countless digital media fans have been clamoring for, the iPod touch is basically the iPhone without any phone features. It features all the iPhone goodness you'd expect, including the multi-touch UI, the Cover Flow views, the icon-based home screen, and landscape video playback. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iPod touch does more than that, however. It includes integrated 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, like the iPhone, which you can use with its integrated Safari browser, YouTube application (a la iPhone), and... drumroll, please... the new mobile version of iTunes, dubbed iTunes Wi-Fi. Yep, Apple jumped on the obvious train and added that feature so many people were looking for: Buying music over the air. Sadly, you cannot sync over the air via Wi-Fi, which would have really completed the picture. There was also a Starbucks announcement that is barely worth mentioning, given that it will taken until 2009 to completely rollout, assuming it ever happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable, but not exceptional, given the capacity: An 8 GB version is $300, while a 16 GB version will set you back $400. Battery life is great, 22 hours for audio and 5 for video, but then you won't be putting much video on this thing with such small amounts of built-in memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this doesn't get an A+ is the storage: Even 16 GB is paltry for a video collection. I honestly believe customers would be OK with a thicker device if they could get an 80 GB or even 160 GB hard drive in there (with the resulting larger battery). Maybe someday that will happen, but this is a wonderful start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iPhone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple is dropping the 4 GB iPhone and, most astonishingly, dropping the price of the 8 GB version by $200 to a much more reasonable $400. I've often referred to the price point on the iPhone as being exorbitant, but this brings it down to reality. Bravo to Apple for being this aggressive this quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iPhone also picks up some iPod Touch features, like iTunes Wi-Fi (sweet) and the silly Starbucks application, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Apple is adding one of many curiously missing features to the iPhone: Ringtone support. Now, customers can buy song ringtones for $1.98: 99 cents for the ringtone itself and 99 cents for the song. It's not the full iTunes catalog, however, but rather a 500,000 song subset. The new version of iTunes, being released "tonight," will also add a ringtone editor so you can recast nonprotected songs from your existing music collection into ringtones yourself. Neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;iTunes 7.4/8?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a new version of iTunes coming tonight, apparently. We don't know much about it beyond the new ringtones stuff and reverse sync with iTunes Wi-Fi, so there's no point in writing it up quite yet. Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Presentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is often the case, Steve Jobs loves playing to the home crowd and the Apple friendly people in the audience--about half were Apple employees according to at least one blogger who was there--ate it all up. I don't like the lies--Apple isn't the first to add a Web browser to a portable media player, example--and I don't like the boasting, but there's no denying that Jobs is the master of this domain. Say what you will, but this time, at least, he was right on target. This stuff &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a solid even exciting event. I'm looking forward to reviewing the new iPods, and iTunes 8.0, if that's what it is. I'm also curious how Microsoft intends to answer this threat with new Zunes, and if that's even possible.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/first-impressions-beat-goes-on.htm' title='First impressions: &apos;The Beat Goes On&apos; Announcements'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/2007223481587589977'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/2007223481587589977'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-3884694974146774505</id><published>2007-09-05T13:44:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-05T13:46:10.718-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Zune'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iPod'/><title type='text'>Zune Price Drop</title><content type='html'>From the Futility Department over at &lt;a href="http://zuneinsider.com/archive/2007/09/05/price-drop.aspx"&gt;Zune Insider&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of you may have already heard, but tomorrow we’re dropping the suggested retail price for Zune to $199.

I got this via email, but it's on the &lt;a href="http://blog.palm.com/palm/2007/09/a-message-to-pa.html"&gt;Palm blog&lt;/a&gt; too:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have decided to cancel the Foleo mobile companion product in its current configuration and focus all of our energies on delivering our next generation platform and the first smartphones that will bring this platform to market. We will, of course, continue to develop products in partnership with Microsoft on the Windows Mobile platform, but from our internal platform development perspective, we will focus on only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because we were nearly at the point for shipping Foleo, this was a very tough decision. Yet I am convinced this is the right thing to do. Foleo is based on second platform and a separate development environment, and we need to focus our efforts on one platform. Our own evaluation and early market feedback were telling us that we still have a number of improvements to make Foleo a world-class product, and we can not afford to make those improvements on a platform that is not central to our core focus. That would not be right for our customers or for our developer community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Hawkins and I still believe that the market category defined by Foleo has enormous potential. When we do Foleo II it will be based on our new platform, and we think it will deliver on the promise of this new category. We're not going to speculate now on timing for a next Foleo, we just know we need to get our core platform and smartphones done first.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So this was obviously the right thing to do. But still, that's quite a turnaround.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/palm-cancels-foleo.htm' title='Palm cancels Foleo'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/7097158493529979024'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/7097158493529979024'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-8035990169805563814</id><published>2007-09-02T13:36:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-02T14:51:11.720-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Zune'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iTunes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Digital media'/><title type='text'>Sync iTunes, Windows Media Player, and Zune</title><content type='html'>I manage my master music collection through iTunes in Windows Vista, but maintain links to this collection in both Windows Media Player 11 and Zune so that I can sync that music with non-Apple devices. This works pretty well, though you have to manually update album art and perform other housekeeping tasks, especially in WMP, fairly often. Turns out there's a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a Windows-based iTunes user, or someone looking to sync music meta data between iTunes and Windows Media Player/Media Center, you need to download a cool utility called &lt;a href="http://www.download.com/3000-2141_4-10709737.html"&gt;MusicBridge&lt;/a&gt; immediately. MusicBridge offers manual one-way sync (in either direction) between iTunes and WMP of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- General meta data &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Album art&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ratings (!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Playlists&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you can export and import ratings (from iTunes) to and from XML. This is an amazing tool, and highly recommended. It's amazing seeing my very thorough iTunes ratings  appear, perfectly, in WMP. The only problem is that the process is manual: You have to sync these things individually, and it's not automated. No problem: MusicBridge works grea, and MusicBridge could easily be used to migrate a music collection from iTunes to WMP, or from WMP to iTunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Zune side, the Zune desktop software actually includes everything you need to sync with iTunes and/or WMP, but you have to enable it: Just Access go to Monitor Folders (Options -&gt; Library -&gt; More Options -&gt; Monitor Folders) and check the option titled "Add files, playlists, and ratings from another media player to library" in the Add Folders to Library dialog. Then click OK and it will all be blasted right into Zune, and kept up-to-date automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is that iTunes, Zune, and WMP now contain nearly identical copies of my music library right now. It's a lot closer to what I've been looking for than I had imagined was possible without a lot of work and duplication. I've been playing with this stuff all weekend, along with some related tools for accessing AAC files from WMP (and thus Media Center, but not Media Center Extender) and removing DRM from iTunes-purchased songs, so they can be used with other players and devices. I may write this stuff up soon, it's really kind of fantastic.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/sync-itunes-windows-media-player-and.htm' title='Sync iTunes, Windows Media Player, and Zune'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/8035990169805563814'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/8035990169805563814'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-8036507132028440989</id><published>2007-09-01T09:05:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-01T09:07:56.949-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iTunes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Digital media'/><title type='text'>Apple, why can't I buy this album?</title><content type='html'>I've been trying to download John Lennon's greatest hits album, Legend, via iTunes Plus for weeks now.

The truth is, this is pretty serious, if you'll accept the notion that anything entertainment related can truly be serious. It's serious because this will impact the way that content is digitally delivered to us in the future, and as technophiles, we should be at the forefront of this discussion. Here's what I really think about this topic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, we have to take all of the public statements that Apple and NBC have said at face value. Yes, both companies are clearly jockeying for position here. But let's assume everything they say, on both sides, is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NBC is wrong. When it comes to music downloads, I provisionally back the notion of tiered pricing, largely because I'm an old guy and much of what I want to buy is of the back catalog nature, and would thus be lowered priced as a result. (I wouldn't care if the new Brittney Spears single is $1.99 instead of $.99, or whatever. As far as I'm concerned, that's not music anyway and I'm not interested.) My particular wants and needs aside, however, tiered pricing can be used to screw the consumer, obviously, and in the case of TV shows, the prices can get quite high. And if Apple is correct is saying that NBC wanted to price new TV show episodes--single TV show episodes--at $4.99 a whack. I mean, my God. That's utterly ridiculous. I look at the $1.99 price now as a bit exorbitant, frankly, since you can get these shows in better quality, and for free, on TV. I mean, I have a Media Center PC. I can skip the commercials already. iTunes is not exactly a bargain, sorry, and I won't typically watch most TV shows, no matter how good, more than once. (Meanwhile, I listen to a lot of music repeatedly, and those files are just 99 cents each.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for tiered pricing, I think older TV shows should cost less than $1.99, and you should get a more substantial discount than is currently available when you purchase an entire season or subscribe to a current season. It's unclear to me why NBC needs to make a lot of money on something like "The A Team" right now. But you know what? I might grab season one out of nostalgia alone if the cost was more reasonable. Perhaps the answer to the tiered pricing question is that new content should always be priced at the current rate, but that older content could be priced lower to move it in higher quantities. (Perhaps content could become lower priced over time, based on when it was added to the store. You wait, you save.) There needs to be a compromise on tiered pricing, in other words, but not one that screws the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both companies are being a bit self-serving here. Coming out in public as they both did in such dramatic fashion suggests that they're both willing to go to the brink. Not surprisingly, talks between NBC and Apple are ongoing. So they're using this as a PR and negotiating tool. Apple, as always, seeks to look like the champion of the little guy. I have to say, while I shudder at such a notion in general, in this case it seems believable. Here, it does appear that Apple represents the consumer's best interests. Thus, I am rooting for them to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put simply, I like that TV shows are available via the iTunes Store, and I've certainly purchased a number of shows that I missed for whatever reason on TV. (It's mostly a backup plan, however. I would never personally subscribe to a new TV show season via iTunes,) This is just another way for networks, in this case, to make money from customers, and it's unclear why they don't see it that way. In this case, NBC is wrong and Apple is right. How any company could be as bald facedly anti-consumer as NBC appears to be right now is beyond me.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/09/but-seriously-folks.htm' title='But seriously folks...'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/1752938388936802988'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/1752938388936802988'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-2283498298117230172</id><published>2007-08-31T13:40:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-08-31T14:03:23.207-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Humor'/><title type='text'>Fun with Headlines, Hazy Hot and Humid Edition</title><content type='html'>Embracing the hypocrisy because its the end of August and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN3123883920070831?rpc=44"&gt;NBC Universal ends contract with Apple's iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple's a jerk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/08/31itunes.html"&gt;iTunes Store To Stop Selling NBC Television Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, NBC is the jerk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2007/08/31.5.shtml"&gt;iMac, Therefore I Am...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... a tool?

The move follows NBC’s decision to not renew its agreement with iTunes after Apple declined to pay more than double the wholesale price for each NBC TV episode, which would have resulted in the retail price to consumers increasing to $4.99 per episode from the current $1.99. ABC, CBS, FOX and The CW, along with more than 50 cable networks, are signed up to sell TV shows from their upcoming season on iTunes at $1.99 per episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We are disappointed to see NBC leave iTunes because we would not agree to their dramatic price increase,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s vice president of iTunes. “We hope they will change their minds and offer their TV shows to the tens of millions of iTunes customers.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple’s agreement with NBC ends in December. Since NBC would withdraw their shows in the middle of the television season, Apple has decided to not offer NBC TV shows for the upcoming television season beginning in September. NBC supplied iTunes with three of its 10 best selling TV shows last season, accounting for 30 percent of iTunes TV show sales.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yikes. Apparently, Apple isn't taking this one lying down.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/08/itunes-store-to-stop-selling-nbc.htm' title='iTunes Store To Stop Selling NBC Television Shows'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/3780633109496651743'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/3780633109496651743'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-896142663418599656</id><published>2007-08-31T11:54:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-08-31T11:57:33.733-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='iTunes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Digital media'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Apple'/><title type='text'>NBC ends contract with Apple's iTunes</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN3123883920070831?rpc=44"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;NBC Universal has decided not to renew its contract to sell television shows on iTunes, becoming the second major media company to challenge Apple Inc's dominance in digital entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NBC Universal had demanded more control over pricing for digital downloads of its shows, which include "Battlestar Gallactica" and "Heroes," said a source familiar with the matter on Friday, confirming a New York Times report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spokeswoman for NBC Universal confirmed it will not renew the contract and declined to elaborate.

"As a result, Sony will be phasing out the Connect Music Services based on Sony's ATRAC audio format in North America and Europe."&lt;/blockquote&gt;And another one bites the dust, in this case not a moment too soon. It's bad enough that Sony went with a format--ATRAC--that no one supported, but its own devices were generally woefully bad.

Not only will the Ubuntu community continue to do what it does best, produce an easy-to-use, reliable, free software platform, but this release will proudly wear the badge of Long Term Support (LTS) and be supported with security updates for five years on the server and three years on the desktop. We look forward to releasing the Hardy Heron in April 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ubuntu community continues to see incredible growth in its diverse range of areas such as packaging, development, documentation, quality assurance, translations, LoCo teams and more. Each new release gives us all an opportunity to shine, irrespective of which bricks in the project we are laying, and this is at the heart of our belief - working together to produce an Operating System that will empower its users and shape the IT industry, putting free software at the corner-stone of our direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to participate, everyone is welcome to get involved, and everyone is welcome to help shape the form of the Hardy Heron. Let’s work together to shake things up, make things happen and make the most compelling Ubuntu release yet. Start your engines…&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nicely said. The Linux community needs a few more people who can communicate like this and push Linux into the world of a choice rather than an alternative to something else.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/08/introducing-hardy-heron.htm' title='Introducing the Hardy Heron'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/3200398555474054297'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/3200398555474054297'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-9084811933056900619</id><published>2007-08-30T09:33:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2007-08-30T09:35:09.118-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vista'/><title type='text'>Windows Vista Service Pack 1 Revealed</title><content type='html'>It's just a service pack, but it sure has garnered a lot of attention. Me, in &lt;a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_sp1.asp"&gt;SuperSite for Windows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;With Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1), now due in the first quarter of 2008, Microsoft is deemphasizing the role that service packs play in the ongoing updating and maintenance of its operating systems. That is, Vista SP1 will be a traditional service pack, collecting previously-issued updates into a single installation, and including few new end user features. It will, however, improve the Vista experience in a number of ways and include new device drivers and other improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Microsoft's continued requests for businesses to not wait for SP1 before deploying Windows Vista may seem self-serving, this week's revelations about the feature set of the service pack suggest that this advice is sound. Windows Vista SP1 looks like a solid and necessary update, but it will not dramatically impact the end user at all. If you're a Windows enthusiast, Vista SP1 is more a curiosity than something to get excited about. It will not include anything interesting or compelling, in an end user sense, such as a new Media Center version. (Which is also overdue, incidentally.) Hopefully, this will end the speculation. I only wish Microsoft had been this upfront about SP1 months ago. It's been a long time coming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Related: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/windowspaulthurrott/Article/ArticleID/96932/windowspaulthurrott_96932.html"&gt;Finally, Microsoft Reveals Vista SP1 and XP SP3 Schedules&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/2007/08/windows-vista-service-pack-1-revealed.htm' title='Windows Vista Service Pack 1 Revealed'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.internet-nexus.com/rss.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/9084811933056900619'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3145489/posts/default/9084811933056900619'/><author><name>Paul</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3145489.post-5334335638278558964</id><published>2007-08-29T15:46:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-08-29T15:48:26.988-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Video games'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Xbox 360'/><title type='text'>Halo's Gone Gold!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=12737"&gt;Bungie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Halo 3  for Xbox 360 has gone Gold!

We’re a family and we made this game for you, our extended family. We hope you like it. Nobody deserves any more recognition than anyone else, but an extra special thanks goes out anyway, to the test team who got it to this stage, in a pool of their own sweat, tears and blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, we wouldn't be here today without the tireless devotion of our fan community - we thank you all as well for supporting Bungie Studios in our never ending quest for World Domination and we look forward to sharing another billion+ hours together on Xbox Live when Halo 3 lands in just  a few short weeks.
