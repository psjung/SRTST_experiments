Known problems:

- Sometimes when using River of News, the sort does not complete leaving the
  "Sorting items..." screen displayed.  By using the back key and trying again
  the same menu item usually resolves this.  Or picking another item and coming
  back to the problem item.
- Phone must support MP3 links, etc to play enclosures (many phones do not
  allow an MP3 to be read from a URL, but play them from the file system)
