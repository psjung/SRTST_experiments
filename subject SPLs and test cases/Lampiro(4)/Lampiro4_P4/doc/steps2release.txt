	- user-build[.*].properties
2) check manifest.* values in user-build[.*].properties
3) check optimizationpasses in user-build.properties (usually 10) 
4) build all (deploy.sh: have a cup of coffee)
5) the three releases (base, compression, TLS) are in the releases version 
6) make a tag on SVN (with the name version)
7) modify the changelog in googlecode
